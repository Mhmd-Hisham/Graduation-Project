#Person2#: Personally, I feel that it is not a very sound idea. It is difficult for two people of entirely different religions to live and share life together. They will face so many problems that it would be better if they don't get married in the first place.
#Person1#: Of course there will be problems. Even two people of the same religion have problems. It is the same in this case. except that it will be slightly more difficult, I guess.
#Person2#: I agree with you, Henry. Naturally, there will be arguments and personal differences. Marriage thrives on a give-and-take policy, so a couple will have to learn to adapt to each other's customs and traditions.
#Person1#: That's right. Married people should be more tolerant towards each other and be willing to learn about each other's religion. Only then can understanding and acceptance be achieved ultimately.
#Person2#: You talk as if it were very simple. It isn't, you know. I should know. as I am a child of a mixed marriage.
#Person1#: All right, you tell us why is is not such a good idea.
#Person2#: You see, Henry, it depends on the individuals concerned. If two people of different religions marry, they should be prepared for the consequences. It is only after marriage that the vast differences in the cultures begin to show. Little things, from food and clothes to bigger aspects like religious beliefs, tend to clash, leading eventually to a rift. Besides. there will be either personal pride or the reluctance to accept the other's views. It may lead to a big gap between the parents, and their children may suffer a lot in between.

#Person2#:Oh , yes , it was very interesting .

#Person2#:Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . 
#Person2#:I taught after school . 
#Person2#:I taught in English institutes . 
#Person1#:But you taught children , yes ? . 
#Person2#:Yes . 
#Person2#:That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school . 
#Person1#:They actually study after school ? . 
#Person2#:That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there . 
#Person1#:Hmm . 
#Person1#:That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . 
#Person1#:Don't they ever relax ? . 
#Person2#:Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . 
#Person2#:I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education . 
#Person2#:More than American parents are . 
#Person2#:And that is good . 
#Person2#:American kids don't study enough . 
#Person1#:Asian cultures value learning very much . 
#Person1#:I know that . 
#Person2#:So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . 
#Person2#:I don't think that's a bad thing . 
#Person2#:I think it's a good thing.In America , too many parents don't pay attention . 
#Person1#:But aren't the kids tired out ? I mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too . 
#Person2#:As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . 
#Person2#:I tried to have a good time with my classes . 
#Person2#:The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . 
#Person2#:So it was a good experience . 
#Person1#:Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient ? . 
#Person2#:That's a stereotype we Americans have.We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet.But it's not true . 
#Person2#:There are plenty of naughty kids too . 
#Person1#:Hmm . 
#Person1#:I know you taught in Costa Rica also.Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan ? .

#Person2#:What do you like to feel when watching a movie?

#Person1#:I don't like to watch movies that make me feel just... bad. Like, I don't like to watch movies that are too realistic to where I feel really sad because they are a possibility. I also do not like very gory movies that make my stomach turn.
#Person2#:Thank you for that information! Will you be seeing this movie with a close friend, do they have any movie preferences?

#Person2#:Based on your description I think both of these movies are a wonderful choice for you but I am going to recommend The Addam's Family. I make this recommendation based on the fact that you do not like gory movies. Zombieland: Double Tap is not for those with weak stomachs.
