#Person1#:Hmm well I'm in the mood for a little bit of romantic comedy or an action thriller! What do you guys have?
#Person2#:We do have one romantic comedy starring Jenny McCarthy and Ryan Reynolds. It is entitled ""Family Jewels"" and has a respectable rating of 69% on Rotten Tomatoes. Essentially, it is about a European diamond dealer who decides to forgo his life to pursue a romantic endeavor with an American con-artist! It IS rated R so it might be a little bit risque for other's taste, but I've thoroughly enjoyed it myself! 
#Person1#:Awesome! That does seem really intriguing. What about any Action-Thrillers?
#Person2#:We do have one movie that might fit your boat! It's entitled ""Beyond the storm""! It is rated PG-13 so you can bring your teenage nephews and nieces along! It is basically about a captain and his crew facing extremely inclement weather and they are also harboring a mutinous traitor on board! It is definitely highly rated at 81% on Rotten Tomatoes, and is directed and depicted by the late James Cameron!

#Person2#:The reviews are mixed for that movie. The controversial side of it might interest you!
#Person1#:I think I may pass on that one. I think I'm leaning toward the Terminator or the Addam's Family.
#Person2#:What do you like about those films?
#Person1#:I never saw a Terminator movie, but I was thinking about trying something new. The Addam's Family is a classic and gives me nostalgia.
#Person2#:I'm sure the Terminator is getting good reviews, it's a fairly reputable series of films. It seems you're leaning toward the Addam's Family.
#Person1#:I agree! The Addam's Family takes me back, and just in time for Halloween too.
#Person2#:It takes me back too! I love those films. Have you decided on one?
#Person1#:The Addam's Family it is!

#Person2#:Great! I would love to help you with this. What kind of movies do you like to watch?
#Person1#:I really love all sorts of movies, but I think I prefer movies that make me feel good. Comedies.
#Person2#:So you're looking for a comedy?
#Person1#:Yes, preferably one that I can go see with friends and laugh at together.
#Person2#:Do you have a particular type of comedy or a rating in mind?
#Person1#:I don't care if the film is rated R or not, but I would prefer there not to be any graphic sex scenes in the film. I do not enjoy watching these kinds of scenes with my family and friends.
#Person2#:Got it, no graphic sex scenes. How about violence?
#Person1#:I'm okay with violence!
#Person2#:There are a couple good comedies out in theaters right now, including The Addams Family, which is animated.
#Person1#:I read a review from a critic I like online that The Addams Family movie was entertaining, but I am not sure whether I would like to see an animated film.
#Person2#:Have you heard of the film Hustlers? If you're interested in critical reviews, that film has gotten excellent feedback from a number of critics.
#Person1#:Yes, I have heard good things about that, but I'm not sure how comedic that film is. I think I would like something that is a more standard comedy. My close friends like films that don't make you think too hard.
#Person2#:Zombieland: Double Tap is a comedy as well that is currently out.
#Person1#:Oh, actually, I saw the first Zombieland and really enjoyed it! I thought it was very fun. I also like other zombie films like Shaun of the Dead, which my friends like as well. It is very entertaining.
#Person2#:It sounds like Zombieland: Double Tap would be a good option, then, if you enjoyed the first one!

I hate bloody, dark, screaming, scary movie. I don't want anything requires too much thinking either. It's not that I can't think but I am watching movie to relax. I got enough thinking at work.

#Person1#:Oh cool. That's something different. The human version of Lion King would be terrifying. I might check that out. Is there anything else non-Disney you can recommend for me.
#Person2#:I think you might like Kungfu Panda. It's so lovely with all of these animals but then it has some Kungfu vine to it. The most important part is it is so funny.
#Person1#:Oh cool. Tell me a little more about it.
#Person2#:It's quiet funny and doesn't requires too much thinking because it is also for kids so it is only scary enough. The film is set in a version of ancient China populated by anthropomorphic talking animals and revolves around a bumbling panda named Po, a kung fu enthusiast. When an evil kung fu warrior named Tai Lung is foretold to escape from prison, Po is unwittingly named the ""Dragon Warrior"", that was destined to defeat him.
#Person1#:Very cool. That's what I am talking about. Is there anything else about that Panda

#Person2#: Yeah.
#Person1#: What was it like?
#Person2#: Well, the first day in Rio was quite a shock for us. Here it was a lot of fat middle-aged Europeans and Americans exercising along the beach, sunbathing, walking with their walkmans. It's a big contrast to the thousands of people sleeping on the street during night.
#Person1#: What was the weather like?
#Person2#: The climate is very different from other places such as Peru or Bolivia. We were at sea level, and we all felt very good about it. No one of us needed to breathe extra air from time to time, and the temperature is about 25 degrees and the air is very humid.
#Person1#: That's really nice.
#Person2#: The first day we had very nice weather, and were able to really relax on the beach. After these two days we had bad weather, rain and cloudy. So, we're a little bit disappointed about that. Due to the weather, we explored the old part of Rio.
#Person1#: How about the food there?
#Person2#: We ate at local restaurant. Tiffs restaurant has a fixed fee of about US $10. Then you can eat as much as you want from a vast and delicate buffet consisting of both seafood and meat. Dessert and drinks are not included.
#Person1#: It's been really a nice trip.

953,"#Person1#:I saw The Addams Family yesterday. I didn't care for the way they animated it; it's too fake looking and doesn't appeal to me the way the one with real actors did. And yet, Maleficent had an opposite effect on me; it took a cartoon story and put real actors into it, and I just wanted to leave the theater. There wasn't anything about Angelina Jolie that made me think of her as a wicked cartoon witch. However I liked the Downton Abbey movie a lot.
#Person2#:I didn't mind The Addams Family movie. I kind of liked the animation but the acting from the voices wasn't really convincing. I saw Maleficent this afternoon; in the cartoon she was sort of glamorous but more scary, but in the new movie she's too perfectly glamorous to be really convincingly wicked, at least to me. Downton Abbey was okay, but I haven't decided what I think yet. I loved the television series, and I loved looking at the sets and costumes, but it seemed a little stale.
#Person1#:You see, I'm a big fan of the Addams Family films from the 1990s, and it's odd as I didn't think I would like them, but I did. But this new film is just a trick film, and the trick doesn't work, in my opinion. I can't imagine that Maleficent will make much money, I'm angry that I had to pay for a ticket. Downton Abbey, however, I'm thinking I want to go see it again. That Maggie Smith is something!
#Person2#:I won't be seeing the Addams Family film again, however, I think if it goes to television and I don't have to pay extra, I might. For myself, I liked the 1960s TV series better. And if Maleficent goes to television, I wouldn't watch again if it was free. But the writing for Downton Abbey is good enough to watch a few times!
#Person1#:Well these days it's tempting to stay home and wait until movies come to television and skip going to a theater altogether! Isn't it just easier?
#Person2#:Not sure. I think I would really miss the whole theater experience.
#Person1#:I wouldn't give up going out to the movies, I like the feeling of suspense before the movie starts and the experience of seeing them with all the people around me.
#Person2#:Okay, okay; but I always eat too much popcorn and raisinets! But seriously, I have to be really impressed with a movie to go out to see it again. I mean, I saw The Addams Family and Maleficent because the advertising kind of made me want to see them, but for Downton Abbey, I didn't need to see an advertisement, I already knew I would like it.\n\n
#Person1#:I guess I could say the same. Downton Abbey has so many wonderful actors and although it's fiction like the others, it has a lot of believable situations in it. But something like Maleficent and The Addams Family, well you have to really be looking for a fantasy movie.
#Person2#:Well for The Addams Family, it was because I knew who the characters were even though they weren't real. But I felt cheated somehow, even though I knew that. Maleficent was a real fantasy, after all it comes from a fairy tale, but it just fell flat for me after a while and kind of was a disappointment even though it started out all right.
#Person1#:You're taking a chance every time you go to the movies, I guess. After all, not everything is going to be a documentary, or you would only be watching history.
#Person2#:You have a point. I guess my expectations are a little too high. I don't like trash, and I especially don't like when the movie makers seem to want to make a great movie and throw a bunch of money out the window and instead make a trashy one. Like I said, one feels cheated.
#Person1#:You can't avoid the risk. At least if you go see films like The Addams Family or Maleficent, you start out with a mind willing to like them. If you don't like them in the end, it's nothing personal, you know?
#Person2#:There you go being right again! But I'm not going to argue about Downton Abbey. In that case, I already knew what to expect in the general look of it and the method, even though I didn't know what was going to happen, since they were so secretive about the plot.
#Person1#:It's fun to see the reviews after you've gone to see the movie, and have imaginary conversations whether you agree with the reviewer or not.

#Person2#:You looking for a comedy, romance, action, drama? Maybe horror?
#Person1#:Ok, definitely not horror. Not in the mood to feel disgusted. I think any other category would be fine. Looking for a fun night. Doesn't have to be all ""party girl"" kind of fun. Just something that we could all enjoy.
#Person2#:Hmmm.... What about Moulin Rouge? Musical, romance, kinda crazy editing, interesting mix of modern songs.
#Person1#:That's a thought. But it's kinda depressing in the end. Don't want the night to end on a downer.
#Person2#:Ok. How about ""The Heat"" with Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy? Can't go wrong with those two right?
#Person1#:Certainly a funny one but maybe a little too foul mouth. I don't know. Maybe I'm looking for something that we can continue to discuss afterward.
#Person2#:Alright. Hear me out on this one. It's a feel good, fun and I think there's a lot in it to discuss afterwards.... The Disney Pixar movie Up.
#Person1#:Aw man. I won't get past the first 30 minutes. That opening montage always has me crying my eyes out. I just can't.
#Person2#:Ok... Going back to Sandra Bullock here. What about The Blind Side.
#Person1#:Hmm.... I think you might be getting closer to what I'm looking for. But this one just felt too Hollywood. I think they glamorized the story too much that just makes it a little too saccharin.
#Person2#:So I guess Forrest Gump is out of the question?
#Person1#:Yeah. That's just way too fantastical.
#Person2#:Let me regroup here. So you're looking for feel good, more realistic, discussion inducing and fun.
#Person1#:Let me clarify fun. It doesn't necessarily have to be funny. When I say fun, I mean, not a movie where we're cringing how bad it is. Fun can be enjoying a movie that's done well.
#Person2#:Hmmm... How about Shawshank Redemption? It's great storytelling. But would you consider this too depressing?
#Person1#:Shawshank! That is a great movie. It does get a little dark but I think in the end, you get that feel good moment. Great suggestion.
